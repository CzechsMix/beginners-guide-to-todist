# Basic Features

In this chapter we will go through the basic features available in a free Todoist account. For most users, these will suffice to increase your productivity using Todoist, but with a premium subscription you get extra features that we describe in the next chapter.

## Tasks

If you complete the default tasks you created when you signed up for your Todoist account---you do this by clicking in the circle to the left of the task title---or if you simply delete them, you should have an empty list of "Today's tasks".

This is where you want to be at the end of each day, but of course you want to be able to add tasks to complete as well. Otherwise, it is easy to get an empty tasks list but absolutely useless as well.

To add a new task, you can click on the "Add task" link.

This gives you a field where you can write the title of the task and the date it should be completed. If you are in the Today list when you add the task, the current date will automatically be inserted as the completion date; otherwise, the completion date will be empty.

You can also "quick add" a task using the keyboard short-cut **Q**. Here, you have the same options as if you add a task in the Today's list, but the task will, by default, be added to the Inbox list, even if you are currently looking at Today's list or a Project, and the completion date will not be automatically set.

Anyway, let us just add a task in the Today's list for now. Just type in a title for the task. Then hit **Enter**.

After hitting **Enter**, you will have a new task open so you can continue adding more and more tasks.

You can just cancel the new task, either by clicking on **Cancel** or by hitting the **Esc** key. If you just added a single task, and you added it in the Today list, you should have a list that looks like this:
