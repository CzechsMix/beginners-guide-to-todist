# Basic Features

In this chapter we will go through the basic features available in a free Todoist account. For most users, these will suffice to increase your productivity using Todoist, but with a premium subscription you get extra features that we describe in the next chapter.

## Tasks

If you complete the default tasks you created when you signed up for your Todoist account---you do this by clicking in the circle to the left of the task title---or if you simply delete them, you should have an empty list of "Today's tasks".

This is where you want to be at the end of each day, but of course you want to be able to add tasks to complete as well. Otherwise, it is easy to get an empty tasks list but absolutely useless as well.

To add a new task, you can click on the "Add task" link.

![Add task button.](figures/add-task-button.png)

This gives you a field where you can write the title of the task and the date it should be completed. If you are in the Today list when you add the task, the current date will automatically be inserted as the completion date; otherwise, the completion date will be empty.

You can also "quick add" a task using the keyboard short-cut **Q**. Here, you have the same options as if you add a task in the Today's list, but the task will, by default, be added to the Inbox list, even if you are currently looking at Today's list or a Project, and the completion date will not be automatically set.

Anyway, let us just add a task in the Today's list for now. Just type in a title for the task. Then hit **Enter**.

After hitting **Enter**, you will have a new task open so you can continue adding more and more tasks.

You can just cancel the new task, either by clicking on **Cancel** or by hitting the **Esc** key. If you just added a single task, and you added it in the Today list, you should have a list that looks like this:

When you write the title of a task, Todoist will try to parse some of what you write and use it as meta-information. If you write something that can be interpreted as a date---like "today", "tomorrow", "next Sunday", "April 15"---it will interpret this as the completion data and use it as such. If you want to put the task in a project---more on projects below---you can write a hash-tag and then the project name, e.g. `#Personal`.

## Setting task priorities

When you create a task you can give it a priority by clicking on the flag to the bottom right of where you write the task title.

This opens a small dialogue where you can select four different levels of priority.

Since you are already typing in the task title, though, you can much easier add a priority by typing "p1", "p2", "p3", or "p4" to pick the priority level.

## Rescheduling tasks

You don't necessarily want to schedule an end date for all tasks. Quite often, you have a large number of tasks for a project, and you want to get through them as the project progresses, but you don't necessarily want to schedule every single task---you will get to them when you get to them. Still, sometimes you have scheduled a task for a given date and yet haven't managed to complete it by that date. That leaves you with an overdue task.

If you click on the three dots to the right of the task title you open the menu for editing the task, and in this menu you can select the option "More" as the three dots there.

Clicking there, options a calendar where you can reschedule the task.

Rescheduling a single task is relatively simple and fast, but if you have somehow managed to get behind on a project or two, so you have many overdue tasks, you might not want to reschedule the tasks individually. If so, Todoist offers an AI-based rescheduling option. To the top-right of the list of overdue tasks you can click on *Reschedule overdue*.

![](figures/reschedule-overdue.png)

The first time you do this, you get a dialogue where you can get more information and where you can sign up to the service.

![](figures/reschedule-signup.png)

If you accept to use the AI, and any time after you have accepted it and click *Reschedule overdue*, you will be presented with a list of suggested dates for your overdue tasks.

The reschedule suggestions will be based on your typical rescheduling patterns for project and kinds of tasks and will improve as the AI learns more about your work patterns.
