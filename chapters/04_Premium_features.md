# Premium features

The basic features you have with a free Todoist account suffices for most users of Todoist, but with a premium subscription you get extra features that enhances the user experience. We describe these features in this chapter. If you are not interested in having a premium subscription, you can skip to the next chapter.

## Labels

Labels provide an alternative and orthogonal way of organising your tasks. You can use projects to organise your tasks so related tasks are grouped together, but tasks often have different relationships depending on how you look at them. Some are related by their due date or priority, aspects you can explicitly specify for all tasks, some are related because they belong to the same overall project, which is what the projects handle, but others are related for example by where you must be to handle tasks---at home, at the office, out shopping---or how much effort it will take to handle them---some tasks you might need to dedicate several hours to, to get into flow, while others you can handle whenever you have a few minutes free. These kinds of tasks can be grouped using labels.

You can get the list of labels you have associated with your tasks by clicking *Labels* to the right of *Projects* to the left of the Todoist window.

In the example shown here, labels are used to tasks that must be performed at home, at the office, and/or when sitting at a computer, tasks that can be handled when there is a little bit of free time ("no brainers"), so we have a list of tasks to do when there is a break between meetings but not time enough to get deep into a project, and then a label for organising travels, where some planning might be needed ahead of time.

You can explicitly define which labels you want to use---just click *Add Label* for each category you want---but you can also define a new label when you add a task to Todoist. When you write the title of a task, say in a "quick add" bar, you can type "@" to start adding a label. After that, just type the label you want to associate with the task. You will be able to autocomplete on existing labels, but you can add a new one this way as well.

After adding a label, the label will be highlighted in the task description.

You can add as many labels as you want.

Incidentally, projects can be associated with tasks the same way, just using "#" instead of "@". Just press "#" and type a project name. Again, you can autocomplete on existing project or type a new project name and create the project when you add the task.

If you move your pointer over a label name you see three dots that you can use to bring up a menu for a label. All you can really do with labels is delete them or edit them.

The only thing you can "edit" about labels, though, is the colour associated with them.
